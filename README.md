What is Streembit?
-----------------

Streembit is an experimental decentralised communication system for humans and 
Internet of Things devices. The purpose of Streembit is to create a free, secure, 
decentralised, peer to peer, open source system that secures your real time communication. 
You can have as many accounts on the permissionless Streembit network as you want. 
No registration, no email address, no personal details are required. 
Streembit will not spam users with ads. Instead of using centralised corporate clouds, 
Streembit runs on a community driven, decentralised, P2P overlay network. 
Streembit uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority: 
discovering contacts, persisting the data and routing  messages are carried out collectively by the network. 

For more information and an immediately useable, binary version of the Streembit software, see http://streembit.github.io/download.
